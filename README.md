Developed by Dongfang Yang and Ekim Yurtsever at [Control and Intelligent Transportation Research (CITR) Lab](http://citr.osu.edu/), The Ohio State University.

Paper: [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03578)

**Updata Log:**
- **2020.09.15**: We have added the instructions for running the pedestrian detection and the data analysis. Please see the section of 'Getting Started'.
- **2020.07.10**: We are still in the process of finalizing the repository. The complete version will be released soon!

## System Overview

Our system is real-time and does not record data. An audio-visual cue is emitted each time an individual breach of social distancing is detected. We also make a novel contribution by defining a critical social density value for measuring overcrowding. Entrance into the region-of-interest can be modulated with this value.

## Camera calibration

NYC Grand Central terminal: We found the floor plan of the building and calibrated the camera by picking landmarks. We provide the transformation matrix in
`calibration/grand_central_matrix_cam2world.txt`

Oxford town center: The original dataset provides the transformation matrix. We added it here also `calibration/oxford_town_matrix_cam2world.txt`

Mall: We could not found the transformation matrix or the floor plan of this dataset. Instead, we first estimated the size of a reference object in the image by comparing it with the width of detected  pedestrians  and  then  utilized  the  key  points  of  the reference object to calculate the perspective transformation. We provide this transformation matrix in `calibration/mall_matrix_cam2world.txt`

## Critical Density

Keeping the social density under the critical value will keep the probability of social distancing violation occurrence near zero with the linear regression assumption.

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Config
The program was developed based on `python 3.7` with `pytorch 1.5`.
We highly recommend to use `conda`. After you have created a new conda environment, use the following command to install pytorch:
```shell
conda install pytorch==1.5.0 torchvision==0.6.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
```

You may also need to install the packages specified in `requirements.txt` file if you don't have them.

### 2. Download Dataset

We provide an alternative link for you to download all the datasets: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G6nZS-EZLrNBC68CRDf-yo2uj3k32j35/view?usp=sharing

Then copy all the files into folder `datasets` in the repository.

### 3. Run Pedestrian Detection

Execute `detect.py` to obtain the detection result. The result will be saved at folder `results` in the repository. Result will be saved as pickle `.p` file for each dataset.

### 4. Run Analysis

Execute `analyze.py` to obtain the analysis result. It will be saved in the same folder `results`.

## My Contribuitions 

These are the contributions added by Anthony Boyko with the University of British Columbia 

adjusted the work proposed above Dongfang Yang and Ekim Yurtsever to add siamfc tracker which can be found https://github.com/huanglianghua/siamfc-pytorch 

These changes adjust siamfc to run on windows and using python 3.8 with pytorch 1.6

with 
```shell
conda install pytorch==1.6.0 torchvision==0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
```
The addition of tracker is used to determine groups and cancel out false positives. In which a regression is run on the change in difference between two people in a frame over time. 

Due to the runtime being quite slow. Subsection of the oxford dataset are only used whereas originally 3 datasets are used.

Also cutoffs where added to the visiualizations to due to a memory error.
